# INST737-Insights-and-prediction-on-H1-B-Dataset

H1B visa is a great way for US-based firms to recruit foreign talent. The US Department of Labour holds the right to certify or deny any application. Applying for the H1B visa is a time consuming and an expensive process in itself. For the employer it requires him to sponsor the visa to its employee. On employees part, the fact that the company reserves the right to withdraw the sponsorship at any time adds to his vulnerability. 
We have exhaustive data regarding H1B applications that were certified or denied by the US Department of Labour. Using this data, we are going to perform predictive analysis using historical data that would be able to give some insight into whether or not the application will be certified. Apart from this, we are also thinking of answering other related socio-economic questions. 

The research questions that our analysis will answer are as follows:
Is the applicant's success with H1B dependent on the selection of agents?
Do chances of getting an H1B visa differ based on the type of job?
Does wage difference beyond the cap limit affect the chances of getting an H1B? 
Eg: If  a certain database administrator is earning $85k and other DBA is earning $90k annually then are the chances of getting an H1B for the DBA who earns $90k higher than one who earns $85k?
Based on the job domain, which worksite/geographic region should an individual target?
Are H1B employees paid less as compared to native employees for the same job?
